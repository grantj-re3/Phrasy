1/  This game is mostly based on the game of hangman. The main
    variations are:

    - word-phrases are supported (not just individual words)
    - instead of only being permitted to guess a single letter,
      the player is also permitted to guess sequences of letters
    - the diagram of a hanging man for incorrect letters has
      been replaced by a (configurable) maximum number of guesses


2/  The "proverbial phrases" list was derived from the Wikipedia
